# Engineer Test

Hello and thanks for taking the time to try this out.
The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your coding and architectural skills. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showcasing development techniques.

## Rules

- We have maximum 60 mins to solve and discuss the test case
- This test should be written in one of our prefered languages (Golang, Python, Rust, Javascript)


## Problem Statement

You need to implement sorting algorithm to sort random of integers.

e.g.

Given 
```
random = [71, 27, 80, 72, 22, 30, 74, 80, 63, 40, 2, 17, 39, 70, 35, 26, 24, 66, 61, 89]
```

Result
```
ordered = [2, 17, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 35, 39, 40, 61, 63, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 80, 80, 89]
```


Good luck!
