# Engineer Test

Hello and thanks for taking the time to try this out.
The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your coding and architectural skills. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showcasing development techniques.

## Rules

-   We have maximum 60 mins to solve and discuss the test case
-   This test should be written in one of our prefered languages (Golang, Python, Rust, Javascript)

## Problem Statement

You need to implement AT LEAST 2 sorting algorithm to sort random of integers, and create a benchmark to present which algorithm provides a more optimized solution. You can use any sorting algorithm that is widely known in computer science (e.g. merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, radix sort, bubble sort, etc.), or your very own version of algorithm.

e.g.

Given

```
random_one = [71, 27, 80, 72, 22, 30, 74, 80, 63, 40, 2, 17, 39, 70, 35, 26, 24, 66, 61, 89]

random_two = [40, 46, 77, 93, 75, 64, 4, 87, 59, 25, 37, 68, 80, 49, 9, 69, 57, 80, 66, 24, 99, 40, 91, 81, 74, 46, 99, 40, 95, 27, 12, 55, 63, 84, 65, 72, 43, 13, 82, 0, 49, 52, 82, 26, 95, 20, 79, 58, 28, 98, 85, 53, 11, 3, 3, 35, 98, 70, 4, 10, 65, 50, 61, 95, 8, 59, 63, 22, 57, 78, 24, 47, 6, 3, 46, 50, 84, 9, 18, 17, 49, 55, 87, 12, 76, 85, 80, 63, 67, 57, 69, 38, 2, 40, 57, 77, 5, 35, 74, 67, 1, 40, 95, 61, 51, 66, 40, 92, 35, 15, 27, 90, 56, 96, 86, 46, 42, 65, 94, 18, 91, 93, 56, 90, 18, 7, 54, 66, 11, 43, 71, 24, 10, 96, 3, 16, 83, 2, 47, 47, 57, 35, 3, 19, 84, 47, 22, 47, 70, 93, 6, 88, 20, 54, 41, 71, 83, 32, 91, 59, 10, 16, 22, 0, 77, 6, 79, 27, 50, 84, 82, 12, 54, 42, 83, 1, 72, 7, 64, 47, 9, 38, 54, 47, 7, 9, 17, 79, 48, 26, 52, 32, 58, 7, 37, 52, 4, 8, 73, 55]
```

```
